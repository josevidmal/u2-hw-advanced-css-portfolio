ITESM Coding Bootcamp - Unit 2 Homework - Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This was a Job-Seeking coding assessment where I was required to build my own Portfolio website coding the HTML and CSS files from scratch. The main objective was to use Advanced CSS, implementing skills learned in Unit 2 of the Coding Bootcamp, like flexbox, media queries, CSS variables, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. The website should resemble a mock-up, which had different sections, like a header with links that should take the viewer to the different sections of the website. The website should also have a section about me, and a secion for my work, with some of the applications that I have made so far. When clicking on each app image the viewer should be taken to the deployed website for the respective application. At the end of the website there shoud be a footer with contact links to reach me. 

One important aspect of this assignment was to build the website with Responsive Web Design in mind, to allow the application to deploy on different screens and devices. To do that I used many media queries for different smart phones, tablets and desktops. I ran into several issues in this process but did my best so far to be alble to see the my portfolio website in different screen sizes (still, there is room for improvement on my part regarding RWD). 

The final website looks like this image:
